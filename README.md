## Name
You already know my name ;)
I'm Pranav.

## Introduction
People often mispronounce my name because the 'R' is rolled. It's an Indian name, a god no less, but I'm just a mere mortal. I hail from India, born there in November 1989. I'm trilingual, speaking English, Hindi, and Marathi fluently. The latter two are Indian languages predominantly spoken around Mumbai, India.

## My Background
My origin story is a bit more complex. Near Western coast of India, there's a small region called Konkan where Jewish settlers once arrived. I descend from one of these families. So, while I'm very Indian, I have slightly different features. For instance, many in my family have green eyes.

Growing up in large cities like Mumbai and Pune, I was immersed in a culture where the hustle never stops. This 'hustle culture' has profoundly shaped me. Moving to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was a significant cultural shift, marking the first time I felt homesick and lonely. It's akin to how people from NYC carry the 'noises of NYC' with them to quieter places.

My American journey began when I arrived to study with only $500 to my name. Initially, it was a struggle. My first job here was as a janitor, which I was fired from for often being late due to studying at night. Fortunately, my studies paid off. The school offered me a Research Assistant position and covered my fees. My career took me from the automotive industry to working for Uber in Pittsburgh when it was a startup focused on autonomous vehicles. From 2016 to 2021, I was involved in building robot cars due to my specialization in self-propelled drones. In 2021, I joined GM's research division, and now I lead a team at a startup in a similar field.

## Hobbies

### Physical hobbies
I've always enjoyed physically demanding activities. During my teens, I hiked in the Himalayas. Nowadays, my primary hobby is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which I've been practicing for nearly five years. I've also tried Muay Thai and boxing, but due to concerns about brain health, I've steered away from contact sports involving head injuries. BJJ is also my primary way of making new friends. Whenever I move to a new city, I show up at the local gym and invariably end up making friends right away. It's a great way to connect with strangers over a common interest.

### Non-physical hobbies
Huge reader of non-fiction, I usually pick a theme and read everything there is to know about it, themes change over time, and over seasons. I do not have goals to read 52 books a year, I just read to learn. 
In limited amounts, I play video games, less than 1 hour a week. I rarely watch TV, when I do, its usually just after a long day to relax. I watch a lot of content on tech, physics and true crime. In 2020, I started a podcast called Combustible Brains, its been idle for a while, but I enjoyed doing it.

### Music
I listen to classic rock, grunge, progressive metal and some EDM. Favorite bands are Pink Floyd, TOOL, Radiohead, Porcupine tree. Favorite artists are Mark Knoffler, David Gilmour, Maynard Keenan James, Jordan Ruddess.

### Other interests
Stand-up comedy, live in person, small or big venues. Bourbon, but a very light drinker (2 drinks is tops!). Enjoy steak, Enjoying cooking. Bad baker.

## Personality
### Positive Traits
Passion for building and learning about the world, especially through technology.
Fascination with our existence and the mysteries of everything from physics to biology.
Skilled listener, a trait developed over time from an initial tendency to be an arrogant, smart kid.
Problem solver and hard worker, trusted and respected for these qualities.
Non-judgmental, but also aware of my own faults.
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI): ENTJ.

### Negative Traits
* Occasional arrogance, particularly in professional settings, though I'm actively working on it.
* Tendency to be aloof when preoccupied with personal or professional issues.

## Values
* Emphasis on the journey over the destination, viewing life as a game where getting better enables us to enjoy and improve our journey.
* Learning and personal growth, believing in the importance of applying knowledge consistently and with discipline.
* Enjoying the process of trying, failing, and then trying again in the pursuit of improvement.

## What's Not Important to Me
Idle gossip, judgment of others' choices, and imposing my morality on others. I believe in letting people live their lives as they please, as long as they do not harm others.
Conflict Resolution Style
Strong advocate for open communication. I believe in addressing even the slightest tensions early on.
There's an Indian saying: "Don't leave the elephant in the shadows; it might just trample you." I resonate with this approach and strive to leave my ego out of conflict resolution, focusing more on listening and understanding.
